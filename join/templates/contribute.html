        GivnTek is designed to help humanity to be able to trade
        without the help of big actors of e-commerce. We believe in the strength of the local level, even in time of war or network downsizing, and thus bring people from
        the same community together. We hope that you will find GivnTek
        convenient and that you will use it for your transactions on a regular
        basis, at least if you have to do it with computers.
